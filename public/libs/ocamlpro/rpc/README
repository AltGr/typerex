**************************************************************************

This library provides a very simple recursive command/response
protocol allowing arbitrarily nested requests/callbacks between
sequential processes (no threads are involved). Implementation are
available in OCaml, Emacs lisp, and Java.

The OCaml implementation is somewhat more modular and generic. The
other two correspond to the class Server.tagged_connection of the
OCaml version, and can only be used as a server (while the OCaml
implementation may be used either as client or server). See:

- ocaml/ocp_rpc.mli for OCaml and general documentation
- emacs-lisp/ocp-rpc.el for the Emacs lisp side
- OcaIDE/Ocaml/src/ocp/OcpWizard.java (from the root) for Java

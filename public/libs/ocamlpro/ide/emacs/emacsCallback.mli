    program started from emacs with [call-process-with-callbacks],
    defined in callback.el, with the same port number. *)

(** Raised if an error occurs during the reading of the command sent
    to Emacs (i.e., a parse error). The string argument is the form
    whose reading failed. *)
exception CallbackReadError of string

(** Raised if an error occurs during the evaluation of the lisp form
    by Emacs. The string argument is the printing of the lisp error
    itself, of the form "(error-condition-name arguments)". *)
exception ErrorInCallback of string

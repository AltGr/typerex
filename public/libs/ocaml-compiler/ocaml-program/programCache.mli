(** Accessing Programs *)

(** The mutable state in this module is global, because it is meant to
    be shared by all program-manipulating processing. We could make it
    a functor if several independent caches are needed.

    We have a global state consisting of a current program and a
    current source file, which are set each time [source_env] is
    called. [Config.load_path] is also set to the absolute load path,
    but we do not use it since we redefine [find_pers_struct] to
    search in the program. *)

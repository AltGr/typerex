This library gives a general description of OCaml programs:
- program.mli describes programs as set of compilation units, with their
  source (and typedtree) file names, preprocessing options, load paths.
- simpleProgram.mli produce program descriptions from simple
  decription files.
- ocpProgram.mli extract program descriptions from ocp-build project
  descriptions
- programCache.mli provides caching for typedtrees and (modified) source
  files, and access to environments, location shifting...

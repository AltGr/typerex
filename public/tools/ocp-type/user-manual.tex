\section{ocp-type}

The \verb!ocp-type! command-line tool is the ``type-only'' OCaml compiler
which is used to extract the binary annotations needed by the
\typerex\ environment. It may be invoked directly or through the
\verb!ocp-wrapper! tools (see below). It accepts the same options and
arguments as \verb!ocamlc!, and the specific option
\verb!-save-types!, to actually write the binary data to a file.

\subsubsection*{Pre-processing}
\verb!ocp-type! also accepts pre-processors through the \verb!-pp!
option, which should output either
\begin{itemize}
\item an OCaml source file (if possible with line-number directives to
  allow an accurate use of \typerex), or
\item an OCaml dumped AST of one of the supported versions (this is the
  default behavior of \verb!camlp4!), or
\item a Camlp4 dumped AST of one of the supported versions, which can
  be achieved by passing the option \verb!-printer Camlp4AstDumper! to
  \verb!camlp4! (this is done automatically if you use
  \verb!ocp-wrapper!).
\end{itemize}
Note that the third option is better than the second one with respect
to locations (the accuracy of which is instrumental to \typerex\
working).

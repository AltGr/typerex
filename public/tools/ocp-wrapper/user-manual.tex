\section{ocp-wrapper}

The command \verb!ocp-wrapper! and the specialized commands
\verb!ocp-ocamlc!, \verb!ocp-ocamlopt!, \verb!ocp-ocamlc.opt!, and
\verb!ocp-ocamlopt.opt! simplify the generation of binary annotations
by invoking \verb!ocp-type! with the appropriate options, as part of
the usual compilation commands. Calling
{\verbsize \begin{verbatim}
        ocp-wrapper -save-types <command> <options and arguments>
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent where \verb!<command>! is one of the OCaml compilers first
invokes this compiler with the exact same options and arguments, and
then runs \verb!ocp-type! (unless the command-line was a linking-only
phase) with the right options and arguments which are deduced from the
original command ones.

\subsubsection*{Shortcuts}

The four \verb!ocp-*! commands are shortcuts for
\verb!ocp-wrapper -save-types <command>! which are useful when a
single executable program is required as compiling command.

\subsubsection*{Options}

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!-with-ocp-type!, \verb!-with-ocamlc!, \ldots: allow to
  customize the \verb!ocp-type!, \verb!ocamlc!, \ldots commands which
  are run.

\item \verb!-v! print the \verb!ocp-type! command which is executed on
  stderr.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pre-processing}
Any \verb!-pp! option appearing in the command line is transformed as
follows when passed to \verb!ocp-type!:
\begin{itemize}
\item if the pre-processor command is (a variant of) \verb!camlp4!,
  then the option \verb!-printer Camlp4AstDumper! is added, which
  yields more accurate location information,
\item otherwise, the command is left unchanged.
\end{itemize}

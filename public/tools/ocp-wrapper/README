				ocp-wrapper

ocp-wrapper is a command line wrapper for the ocaml compilers which
makes easier the systematic use of ocp-type and ocp-rtt.

To use ocp-wrapper, just prefix your compilation commands by "ocp-",
or by "ocp-wrapper [options] ". To use it for a whole project, use for
example "ocp-ocaml.opt" or "ocp-wrapper [options] ocamlc.opt" as
compiler.

The following compilation commands are supported:
- ocamlc
- ocamlopt
- ocamlc.opt
- ocamlopt.opt

The available options are:
  -save-types          Save typedtrees using ocp-type
  -v                   Print executed commands to error output
  -help                Display this list of options
  --help               Display this list of options

To be compatible with other wrapper or build systems which only
support 'single-word' commands, ocp-wrapper behaves particularly if
called with ocp-wrapper-<compiler> as executable name. This is
equivalent to ocp-wrapper -save-types <compiler> with the same
arguments.
